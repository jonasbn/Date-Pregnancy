NAME
    Date::Pregnancy - calculate birthdate and week numbers for a pregnancy

SYNOPSIS
            use Date::Pregnancy qw(calculate_birthday);
        
            my $dt = DateTime->new(
                    year  => 2004,
                    month => 3,
                    day   => 19,
            );
            $birthday = calculate_birthday(first_day_of_last_period => $dt);

            $birthday = calculate_birthday(
                    first_day_of_last_period => $dt,
                    period_cycle_length      => 28,
            );

DESCRIPTION
    This module can be used to calculate the due date for a pregnancy, it
    implements 3 different methods, which will give different results.

    The different methods are described below in detail (SEE: METHODS).

    This module relies heavily on DateTime objects in order to calculate
    dates of birth, week numbers and month numbers. It does however not
    require Michael Schwern's module Sex.

  calculate_birthday
    Calculates date of birth.

    Takes one named parameter:

    * first_day_of_last_period

    Which should be a DateTime object indicating the first day of the last
    period.

    If the period cycle length varies from the average og 28 days, you can
    optionally provide the named parameter:

    * period_cycle_length

    This defaults to 28.

    The default method used for calculating date of birth is the 266 days
    method (SEE: Methods). If you want to use one of the other methods you
    can use the named parameter method and specify either:

    * 40weeks

    * countback

    The function returns a DateTime object indicating the calculated day of
    birth or undef upon failure.

  calculate_week
    Calculates in what week the pregnant person currently is. A pregnancy is
    in average 40 weeks these weeks numbers are normally used when talking
    pregnancy and most guides, books and websites refer to the different
    stages of pregnancy using these week numbers.

    Takes one named parameter:

    * first_day_of_last_period

    Which should be a DateTime object indicating the first day of the last
    period.

    Optionally you can provide it with a named date parameter if you want to
    calculate the week number for a given date. The date specified should be
    a DateTime object, this defaults to now, when not provided.

    Also a named parameter called birthday can be provided, if you already
    have an birthday DateTime object. If this is not provided calculate_week
    will call calculate_birthday internally.

    As for calculate_birthday the function also takes the named paramter:

    * first_day_of_last_period

    and

    * method

    Please refer to calculate_birthday.

    The function returns an integer indicating the week of the pregnancy or
    undef upon failure.

  calculate_month
    Calculates in what month the pregnant person currently is (see also
    calculate_week). A pregnancy is in average 9 months.

    Takes one named parameter:

    * first_day_of_last_period

    Which should be a DateTime object indicating the first day of the last
    period.

    Optionally you can provide it with a named date parameter if you want to
    calculate the month number for a given date. The date specified should
    be a DateTime object, this defaults to now, when not provided.

    Also a named parameter called birthday can be provided, as for
    calculate_week, if you already have an birthday DateTime object. If this
    is not provided calculate_month will call calculate_birthday internally.

    As for calculate_birthday the function also takes the named paramter:

    * first_day_of_last_period

    and

    * method

    Please refer to calculate_birthday.

    The function returns an integer indicating the month of the pregnancy or
    undef upon failure.

METHODS
    This module implements 3 different methods for calculating the date of
    birth based on data such as first day of last period (LMP) and average
    period cycle length (APCL).

    The 3 methods are:

    266 Days (the one used by default)
    40 Weeks
    Count Back

  266 Days
    This method uses the APCL together with the LMP.

    It adds the APCL divided by 2 to the LMP in the case where APCL is equal
    to or lower than the average of 28 days.

    In the case where the APCL is higher than the average it adds the APCL
    multiplied by 0.85 multiplied by 2 divided by 3 to the LMP.

  40 Weeks
    This method does not use the APCL, but simply counts 40 weeks, the
    number of weeks in an average pregnancy from the LMP date.

  Count Back
    The count back method adds 7 days to the LWP and deducts 3 months, you
    then have to add 1 year in the case where and your have the estimated
    date of birth.

TEST DATA
    I am very interested in improving this module, so if you have the
    opportunity of submitting me test data it is more than welcome.

    The format should be either a test file (*.t), where you choose the file
    name yourself (see t/Villads.t) or you simply submit me the date of the
    first day of the last period for the pregnant person, the lenght time
    between periods if this varies from the avarage of 28 and possible the
    result of your own/your doctor's week number calculation, then I can use
    these data to validate the calculation methods used in this module.

    If possible please include the information on what method your doctor is
    using if this is available (SEE: METHODS).

BUGS
    Please report issues via CPAN RT:

DISCLAIMER
    The method of calculating day of birth and week numbers implemented in
    this module is based on simple formulars.

    The ultra sound scan is a much more accurate method and finally babies
    seem to have a will of their own, so please do only use the results of
    this module as a guideline, the author of this module cannot be held
    responsible for the results of calculations based on use of this module.

    Feedback is welcome though aswell as test data (please see TEST DATA
    above).

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
    * Thomas Eibner, who ALWAYS asks me whether I am a father by now and
    acuses me of pregnant-talk (just because he cannot calculate the weeks),
    now he can find out by looking at the tests included in this module or
    by using this module.
    * Lars Balker Rasmussen, who could not find Date-Pregnancy in his
    include path "lbr can't locate Date/Pregnancy.pm in @INC" - Now he has
    no excuse Date::Pregnancy is a reality.
    * Lars Thegler for making me revisit the alpha version.
